projects from data science classes in R

This repository includes two projects that I wrote full papers for (hence the '.docx' file types).
The first project required me to build a home price model and test various model specifications
for level of prediction accuracy and minimized variance.
The second project was a classification challenge using a LASSO logistic regression.

There is also a project in which I used data from the American National Election Survey to
predict how cynicism affects voter turnout. There is both my full .R code and an R markdown
file that was used to present my process to a group.
